Please adhere to the following convention while naming files - 
Filename = p[number]_[name of file].extension
The number succeeding 'p' should correspond to the number in the table or its respective filetree.

For example:
Bike Dataset for Classification is named as: p1_Bike_Data.csv
All the Machine Learning Classification Algos that work on this dataset share the same initial filename (i.e. 'p1' )
